    <h1>ðŸ“œ Metadata Extraction Guide</h1>
    <p>To use the <code>extract_metadata.sh</code> script for extracting metadata from images, follow these step-by-step instructions. This assumes the script is already written and ready for execution. The script's purpose is to extract metadata (such as geolocation, camera details, timestamps, etc.) from images and check where the image has been used online, as you might have requested earlier.</p>

   <h1>ðŸ¤– Step-by-Step Guide:</h1> 

Ensure Required Tools Are Installed The <code>extract_metadata.sh</code> script might require some external tools like ExifTool for metadata extraction and curl or wget for online searches. Install the required tools first:
ExifTool: Used for extracting metadata from images.

```
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl curl/wget
```
**: For sending HTTP requests (if the script checks where the image is used online).**

```
sudo apt-get install curl
```

```
sudo apt-get install wget
```

```
git clone https://github.com/an0s-voldigoad/Image-Metadata-Extractor.git
```

```
cd Image-Metadata-Extractor
```

```
chmod +x *
```

```
bash extract_metadata.sh
```
